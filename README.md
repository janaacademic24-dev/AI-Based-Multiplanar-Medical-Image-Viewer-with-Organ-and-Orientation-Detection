# AI-Based-Multiplanar-Medical-Image-Viewer-with-Organ-and-Orientation-Detection
An AI-powered medical imaging tool that automatically detects the organ and determines the scan‚Äôs orientation . The project uses a pretrained AI model and displays the slices in an interactive multiplanar viewer (MPR) with axial, coronal, sagittal, and oblique views.  Users can scroll through slices, zoom in/out, and see dynamic reference lines.
# üß† Enhanced DICOM Viewer

A modern **medical imaging tool** designed for exploring, analyzing, and visualizing **DICOM datasets** interactively.  
Built with **Python, PyQt5, VTK, and OpenCV**, this viewer provides a smooth graphical interface for radiological data analysis, segmentation, and visualization.

---

## ü©ª Overview

The **Enhanced DICOM Viewer** enables researchers and biomedical engineers to:
- Load and explore **3D medical image datasets**.
- View **Axial**, **Sagittal**, **Coronal**, and **3D Oblique** slices.
- Perform **basic image analysis**, apply filters, and manage **regions of interest (ROI)**.
- Enhance visualization using **histograms**, **window/level control**, and **intensity projections**.

---

## üß© Features
1) Detection of the organ and its orientation, using pre-trained Ai model.
2) Zooming in and out.
3) controlling the brightness and contrast.
4) Displaying the organ in 4 views (Sagittal,coronal,axial and oblique)
5) Saving limited volume for any of the view ports
6) Dynamic reference lines.
    

### üñ•Ô∏è Visualization
- Multi-view display: Axial, Sagittal, Coronal, and 3D.
- Adjustable **window/level** controls for contrast and brightness.
- Support for **MIP (Maximum Intensity Projection)** and **Oblique planes**.
- Slice navigation via mouse or slider.

### üß† Analysis & Processing

- ROI selection, measurement, and management.    
- Real-time updates across all views.
